## E-Ink Weather Station with OpenWeather by James Harris

This repository is still in development. It is designed to pair the eInk Featherwing (https://openweathermap.org/current)
with the ESP-32 Feather Board (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)

### Requirements

You will need the latest version of the Arduino IDE with the latest ESP-32 board manager
(Instructions: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)

You will also need the Arduino JSON library (https://arduinojson.org/)

The app uses OpenWeathermap. You will need to register for an account and a token here:

### Acknowledgements 
This project was based on Adafruit's sample code for the e-Ink display, as well as about half
a dozen projects and Stackoverflow posts I found on how to read and interface with the OpenWeather API
